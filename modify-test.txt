》》Write a Python program that does the following:
1. Enter content into command line interface. If the input is blank, read contents of question.txt file in current directory using utf-8 encoding and save it as "text" string. If both inputs are empty, output "Input content is empty" and end program.
2. Import "api" package; pass contents of "text" into api.code() function
3. Pass characters between two backticks to the next occurrence after them (excluding first line) in return value from api.code() as "code", then write it using utf-8 encoding to code.py file in current directory (create if not exist, overwrite existing content). 
4. Run code.py; save output contents of code.py into "result" string and pass text, code, result strings sequentially into api.code_check() function.
5. If there is no occurrence between backticks after running step 3's command in the return value from previous call to api functions (or if it matches nothing), then print out returned content; end program
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until reaching limit of five times, and output "It cannot be determined whether or not this code meets expectations" upon completing all attempts without error at last step OR output "The code does not run correctly", ending the process after the fifth attempt with an error.

This app implements the features you described. Make sure that the 'api' package is installed correctly and that the 'code', 'code_check', and 'code_error' functions are included in the package before running this program.
