¡·¡·Write a Python program that does the following:

1. Read all .txt files in the "code" folder (including subfolders) using UTF-8 encoding.

2. Import the 'api' package and concatenate the file paths read from step 1 into a string, along with their contents. However, replace the filenames within each path's directory to include any similarly named but different format files in that location (e.g., if there is both an .txt version of a document as well as a .py version at some point above). Once all text from these concatenated strings has been collected, pass it into `api.summarize()`.

3. Save the string returned by `api.summarize()` in UTF-8 encoding to a file named 'summarize.txt' within the current directory.

```python
import os
import glob
import api

def find_matching_file(path, extensions):
    dir_name = os.path.dirname(path)
    base_name = os.path.basename(path)
    name_without_ext = os.path.splitext(base_name)[0]
    
    for ext in extensions:
        matching_file = os.path.join(dir_name, f"{name_without_ext}{ext}")
        if os.path.exists(matching_file):
            return matching_file
    return path

def read_files_in_directory(directory):
    txt_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, '**', '*.txt'), recursive=True)
    content = ""
    for txt_file in txt_files:
        with open(txt_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file_content = file.read()
        
        matching_file = find_matching_file(txt_file, ['.py', '.md', '.csv'])
        content += f"{matching_file}\n{file_content}\n"
    
    return content

def main():
    directory = 'code'
    content = read_files_in_directory(directory)
    
    # Assummarizeing api.summarize() is a function that takes a string and returns a string
    import api
    result = api.summarize(content)
    
    with open('summarize.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation:

1. **find_matching_file**: This function accepts a file path and a list of extensions. It attempts to find files with the same name but different extensions in the same directory. If it finds one, returns the path of the matching file; otherwise, return the original path.
2. **read_files_in_directory**: This function reads all `.txt` files within specified directories (including subdirectories) and builds a string where each entry is followed by content from corresponding 'matching' .txt files with different extensions if found in same directory or returned to be unchanged, respectively for non-matching .py files.
3. **main**: This function co-ordinates the entire process. It reads file contents into a single joined string using `str.join`, calls an API's summarize() method on this combined content and then writes the output summary back into 'summarize.txt'.

Assumptions:
1. The "api" module has a feature named "summarize", which accepts a string as input, processes it in some manner (possibly for text summaries), and returns another string.
2. This script is being run within an environment where the `api` module can be accessed.
